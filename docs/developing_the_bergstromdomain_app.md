# Developing the BergstromDomain Main Application  #
> I was first introduced to *Ruby on Rails* in 2008 when I worked at Tilgin. We used it as our test framework. Since then, I have had a few attempts of developing my own apps but I've never really got to the point of deploying a working app. In this blog series I'm documenting the steps I've taken to create and deploy my first app.
