# Developing the BergstromDomain Rails Application #
> I was first introduced to *Ruby on Rails* in 2008 when I worked at *Tilgin*.  I managed the development of a test automation framework based on Ruby on Rails combining Ruby-, Bash- and PHP-scripts and as well as test specifications and reports written in *LaTeX*.
>
> Since then, I have taken some online courses and I have had a few attempts of developing my own apps. None of them have been matured enough to be deployed.
>
> In this blog series I'm documenting the steps I'm taking to create and deploy my first app.
